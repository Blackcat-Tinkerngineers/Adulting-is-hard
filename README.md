  ## About the Project
  <p></p>
  
The project assignment is to build a note tracker.
Functions and user experience include; first, you are welcomed to the home page, which is routed to the notes section. 
Via Notes pages, you will see previous note entries, and the right column is an open field area to add additional notes. 
Upon typing your note, the top right on the navigation bar areas a save icon, and beside the previous entries, you can delete whichever you choose.
